# Text Summarization on Turkish Documents by K-means and Hierarchic Clustering Algorithms

## Overview
Text summarization by text mining tools has big advantage over summarizing long documents manually. In this paper a tool for summarizing text by document clustering is described. Two different clustering algorithms are applied for text summarization. With both of the clustering algorithms, statistical features are used to determine the most important sentences on the text to generate a summarized version of the text.

## Introduction
Text summarization is done with many methods. In this paper an extractive method is implemented. Extractive approach on text mining analysis data and extract important features and generates summarization by fusing these features rather than generating the summarization by using natural language generation techniques which is an abstractive approach [1].

In the project sentences on the document that needs to be summarized are extracted and threaded as separate documents. On generated documents, document clustering is applied and most central document of clusters are detected. These sentences/documents are combined to construct summarization document.

Additional to explaining implementation of a text clustering tool, comparison between two clustering algorithms; k-means clustering and hierarchic clustering which are used for document clustering is made in this paper.

## Realization of the Project
The project is implemented on R Studio IDE. “TM” package for R Studio is used for common text mining operations.

Primarily source document to summarized, is partitioned to its sentences. A corpus is constructed where each sentence is threaded as a separate document. All of the letters in corpus are converted to lowercase and punctuations are removed before removing stopwords in Turkish of each corpus by using stopwords list in Turkish by Can et al. [2]. Other document preparation operations applied are removing consecutive white spaces and stemming, respectively.

Posterior to preparing corpus, document-term matrix is constructed. Hierarchic clustering doesn't need a preset clustering number but since k-means clustering algorithm requires; number of clusters is determined by having the square root of total number of documents(sentences) then k-means and hierarchic clustering algorithms are applied to corpora by considering euclidean distance as distance measure between rows of document-term matrix.

Centers of clusters those are generated by k-means and hierarchic clustering are determined by minimum distanced document to average document vector of documents in each cluster of the document-term matrix.

Set of most central documents(sentences) of each cluster is output as the summary of input document.

## Experimentation
For testing performance of the system with k-means and hierarchic clustering algorithms, an experiment is set and applied on participants.

Turkish text summarization by hierarchic clustering and k-means clustering algorithms is applied to ten documents those consists politic news and output of both summarization by k-means and hierarchic clustering are collected for each new. The news include around 45 sentences.

Full text of the news and two choices those are generated by k-means and hierarchic clustering, for each new is given to the participants and asked to select the most informative summary.

Order of 2 selections are shuffled for preventing any inequality on testing efficiencies of the two algorithms.

## Conclusion
Since the experiment that is made is not sufficiently comprehensive, having a solid conclusion about performance of the system and performance of the two clustering algorithms, k-means and hierarchic, with this system is not conceivable.

Whereas, by the results in hand, it may be seen that, hierarchical clustering get more success over k-means clustering by getting chose 74% on the 10 different documents by 5 participants.

Therewithal on the 90% of the documents, hierarchic clustering chose by the majority of the participants. All of the participants chose the summaries those are generated by hierarchic clustering more than k-means [table 1].

## Note
This project was completed as a student project at 9 Eylül University – Computer Engineering Department in 2016.
